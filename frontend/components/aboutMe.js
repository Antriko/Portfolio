                What first brought me into coding was the Computer Science subject in Secondary School. I quickly discovered that I had a natural knack for applying code practically, often finding joy in solving problems through logical thinking and problem solving.

                Since then, I enrolled in a Software Engineering apprenticeship program for over 2 years. Throughout the apprenticeship journey, I was able to recieve hands-on expereience in both mobile game development and web development.

                After my apprenticeship, I went to get further education by going for a Bachelors of Engineering degree for Software Engineering awarded by University of Bolton. With dedication and hard work, I not only completed the program but achieved the distinction of graduating with first-class honors.
